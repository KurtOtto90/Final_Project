Week One tasks:
Select a topic
Movies reviews and Gross spending
Sentiment analysis 
Formulate a question
 dataset has two main tables/csv files: one contains data for each film and the other for each review. With that in mind, there are two major directions you can go:
What factors are most predictive of a film's final "tomatometer" score? Or
Can we predict whether a review is classified as positive or negative based on the review text or metadata about the review?
to use the tomatometer score as a predictive (independent) variable instead of a dependent variable
Lets say we add another dataset for gross profit. Would we need to then merge the datasets to see if positive reviews lead to higher gross profit?
 
pick one major question (e.g., what I said above) and then pose a few hypothesis

Rotten Tomato
Possibly the Gross Profit (if we decide to go that route)
