        <h1>Movie factors, and revenue analysis</h1>
        <p> This analysis is about the relationship of movie factors, and possible revenue the movie may generate. The team wanted to see if certain movie factors affected the movie's revenue.
            We analyzed a movie dataset from Kaggle with various factors such as budget or release date to further investigate this relationship. Our main question to be answered is the following:
            <br> <br> Can movie factors predict the movieâ€™s revenue? Which movie factors are better predictors of the movies revenue?
