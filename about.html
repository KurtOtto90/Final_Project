        <p> Why analyize this topic? Movie factors such as reviews or release date are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. The team wanted to explore the relationship between movie factors ability to predict the success of a
            movie based on itâ€™s revenue.</p>

        <p> Technologies used: Python, PGAdmin, Tableau, HTML, Jupter notebook, Visual Studio Code, Github, JavaScript, and Getbash </p>

        <p> The question we set out to answer is what factors could be used to best predict movie revenue. To answer this, we chose to use random forest regression and multiple linear regression. The choice to use both was made to compare one against the other to see which model produced the best results. The random forest regression is an ensemble of decision trees. Each individual tree is created from a different sample of rows and at each node, a different sample of features is selected for splitting. Each tree then makes its own individual prediction which are average to create a single result. Multiple linear regression also known as multiple regression or MLR is a statistical technique that is used to predict the outcomes of a variable based on one or more separate variables. The dependent variable is the one that we want to predict and the variables that are used for the prediction are known as independent variables.  </p>
